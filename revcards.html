            {
                question: "How does a patient with reduced tidal volume breathe?",
                answer: "Shallowly and often rapidly.",
                explanation: "Tidal volume is the amount of air moved in one breath. If it's low, the patient must breathe faster (tachypnea) to compensate and maintain adequate oxygenation."
            },

            {
                question: "What is the normal capillary refill time?",
                answer: "2 seconds.",
                explanation: "To test this, you press on a nail bed until it turns white, then release. The color should return within 2 seconds. A longer time suggests poor peripheral perfusion."

                question: "What kind of a reading can you get if you use a blood pressure cuff that's too small?",
                answer: "A falsely high reading.",
                explanation: "A cuff that is too small for the arm over-constricts the artery, requiring more pressure to occlude it, which artificially inflates the reading."
            },
            {
                question: "How do you auscultate a patient's blood pressure?",
                answer: "Place a stethoscope over the brachial artery and listen for the return of Korotkoff sounds as you slowly release the pressure from the cuff.",
                explanation: "The first sound you hear is the systolic pressure. The point where the sound disappears is the diastolic pressure."

                question: "What should happen to a patient's pupil when you shine a light in it?",
                answer: "It should constrict (get smaller).",
                explanation: "This is a normal pupillary light reflex. Both the pupil with the light and the other pupil (consensual response) should constrict."
            },

            {
                question: "What's the first thing you do when you arrive on scene?",
                answer: "Ensure scene safety (BSI, Scene Safety).",
                explanation: "This is the absolute first priority. It involves looking for hazards to yourself, your partner, and the patient before any other action is taken."

                question: "What is the job of the first unit at a mass casualty incident (MCI)?",
                answer: "Establish command and begin triage.",
                explanation: "The first crew on scene does not treat patients. Their role is to take command, get an overview of the situation, and quickly sort patients by priority (triage) to direct incoming resources."

            {
                question: "What is the goal of the primary (initial) assessment?",
                answer: "To identify and treat immediate life threats.",

                question: "What is NOT found in the upper airway?",
                answer: "The bronchi and alveoli.",
                explanation: "The upper airway consists of the nose, mouth, pharynx, and larynx. Its function is to warm, filter, and humidify air before it reaches the lower airway."
            },
            {
                question: "What are the structures of the lower airway?",
                answer: "The trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.",
                explanation: "The lower airway begins below the larynx and is where gas exchange actually takes place."

                question: "What is the epiglottis? How is it described?",
                answer: "A leaf-shaped flap of cartilage at the base of the tongue.",
                explanation: "Its function is to cover the opening of the trachea (the glottis) during swallowing to prevent food and liquid from entering the lungs."
            },
            {
                question: "Where does the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide take place?",
                answer: "In the alveoli.",
                explanation: "These are tiny air sacs in the lungs that are surrounded by capillaries. Oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the blood, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled."

            {
                question: "What happens when you inhale?",
                answer: "The diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, creating negative pressure in the chest, which draws air into the lungs.",
                explanation: "This expansion of the chest cavity decreases the pressure inside relative to the atmosphere, causing air to rush in."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the diaphragm?",
                answer: "A large, dome-shaped muscle at the base of the chest cavity that is the primary muscle of breathing.",
                explanation: "When it contracts, it flattens and moves downward, increasing the volume of the chest cavity."

            {
                question: "Is exhalation an active or passive process?",
                answer: "Passive.",
                explanation: "Normally, exhalation does not require muscle contraction. The muscles relax, and the natural elasticity of the chest wall and lungs causes them to return to their resting size, forcing air out."
            },
            {
                question: "What is Tidal Volume?",
                answer: "The amount of air that is moved into or out of the lungs during a single normal breath.",
                explanation: "Adequate tidal volume is just as important as respiratory rate. Breathing that is too shallow (low tidal volume) will not be effective, even if the rate is fast."

                question: "Of the 21% oxygen we inhale, how much do our bodies use?",
                answer: "About 5%. We exhale around 16-17% oxygen.",
                explanation: "This is why rescue breathing is effective. The air you exhale still contains enough oxygen (about 16%) to sustain a non-breathing person."

                question: "What is the primary stimulus for a healthy individual to breathe?",
                answer: "An increased level of carbon dioxide in the blood.",
                explanation: "The brain's respiratory center is highly sensitive to CO2 levels. When CO2 rises, the brain signals the body to breathe more rapidly and deeply to expel it."
