                correctAnswer: "Recheck the patient's blood pressure.",
                explanation: "Nitroglycerin's primary side effect is hypotension. You must re-assess the blood pressure before every dose to ensure the systolic pressure is still above the contraindication threshold (usually 100 mmHg)."

                correctAnswer: "Is a new symptom or is occurring with less exertion than in the past.",
                explanation: "The key to 'unstable' angina is a change from the patient's normal pattern. This suggests the underlying coronary artery disease is worsening and the patient is at high risk for a full-blown AMI."

                explanation: "The brief pause at the AV node ensures that the atria have finished contracting and have ejected their blood into the ventricles before the ventricles are stimulated to contract. This maximizes cardiac output."
